### Project Requirements:  
1. Write code that tests the edge cases and averages for three popular sorting algorithms.
2. Write code that generates a series of random numbers

#### Project Outline  
* This study will implement three algorithms: Quicksort, Insertion sort, and BubbleSort. Then compare their running times after sorting lists of data of varying lengths.
